<p>Now your task is to represent your alternatives (options) and their pros and cons in a certain format. The idea is to represent each alternative with a set of "criteria"; each criterion is a property of the option or its likely outcome. For examine, if you're choosing between job offers, a criterion could be <b>Salary</b>. You can have as many criteria as you want. The important thing is to have enough criteria to capture what makes options appealing or unappealing to you, but not have so many that you get overwhelmed—if you don't care about something, don't use it as a criterion. I suggest aiming for 2 to 7.</p>

<p>Each criterion has several possible values, called "levels", and the levels are ordered with the worst first and the best last. So you might give <b>Salary</b> the levels <b>Low</b>, <b>Medium</b>, and <b>High</b>. You could just as well change these levels (e.g., adding <b>Very high</b> after <b>High</b>), or you could use dollar amounts instead of words. The important thing is that you have enough levels to describe your alternatives, and later levels are better than earlier ones. So if two jobs have different salaries in dollars, but the difference is too small to affect your decision at all, you should use the same level of <b>Salary</b> for both alternatives. The differences between levels aren't assumed to be equally important—you might care about <b>Salary</b> going from <b>Low</b> to <b>Medium</b> much more than from <b>Medium</b> to <b>High</b>.

</p>

<p>Here's a complete example of a situation in which somebody is deciding between job offers:</p>

<div class="problem_example">

<div>Criteria</div>

<ul>
<li>Salary
<ol><li>Below average<li>Average<li>High</ol></li>
<li>Location
<ol><li>Far from home<li>Close to home</ol></li>
<li>Training opportunities
<ol><li>Low<li>High</ol></li>
</ul>

<div>Alternatives</div>

<ul>
<li>Dewey, Cheatem &amp; Howe
<ul><li>Salary: Below average<li>Location: Close to home<li>Training opportunities: High</ul></li>
<li>Ray's Wraps
<ul><li>Salary: Average<li>Location: Far from home<li>Training opportunities: High</ul></li>
<li>MicroCo.
<ul><li>Salary: High<li>Location: Far from home<li>Training opportunities: Low</ul></li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Here's an example of a yes-or-no decision, in which somebody is deciding whether to drop out of college. Remember, criteria levels are listed worst-first, so we put the <b>High</b> level of the criterion <b>Cost</b> before <b>Low</b>, unlike <b>Salary</b> above.</p>

<div class="problem_example">

<div>Criteria</div>

<ul>
<li>Cost
<ol><li>High<li>Low</ol></li>
<li>Future job opportunities
<ol><li>Somewhat less<li>Somewhat more</ol></li>
<li>Social life
<ol><li>Worse<li>Better</ol></li>
<li>Town I'll live in
<ol><li>Worse<li>Better</ol></li>
</ul>

<div>Alternatives</div>

<ul>
<li>Stay
<ul><li>Cost: High<li>Future job opportunities: Somewhat more<li>Social life: Better<li>Town I'll live in: Worse</ul></li>
<li>Drop out
<ul>
<li>Cost: Low<li>Future job opportunities: Somewhat less<li>Social life: Worse<li>Town I'll live in: Better</ul></li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Make sure to only include alternatives that are real options you could actually take, not just options you wish that you had. After all, the point of this exercise is to help you make a real choice. But, you can certainly include criteria that represent a feature of the alternative or its outcome that you're only giving your best guess about, like how much you'll learn in a training program.</p>

<p>Enter the criteria you want to use:</p>

<ul id="criteria_entry">
<li id="new_criterion_li">
<button id="new_criterion" type="button">Add a criterion</button></li>
</ul>

<p>Below are the worst possible and best possible options, according to your criteria. Look at them to double-check that your criteria and levels make sense. Of course, these options might not be real alternatives you could actually choose.

<ul>
<li>Worst option
<ul id='possible-option-0'></ul></li>
<li>Best option
<ul id='possible-option--1'></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Now enter the alternatives and rate them on the criteria. (You can still edit the criteria above, but doing so will reset your choices of criterion levels here.)</p>

<ul id="alt_entry">
<li id="new_alt_li">
<button id="new_alt" type="button">Add an alternative</button></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you've described your decision situation in terms of criteria and alternatives, my program will try to help you pick the best alternative. It can't always provide useful information, but it will do its best. The idea is to ask you to choose between some hypothetical options that are hopefully easier to judge than the real alternatives. Then, the program will do some math to infer what should be the best alternative, given some basic assumptions about how preferences work. Ultimately, you don't have to go with the alternative that the program says you should; it's just a recommendation.</p>
