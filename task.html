[DECISION_PROBLEM_INTRO]

<p>Briefly describe the decision you'll consider for this study. Don't include any personally identifying details. You can use the decision you already described in the screener form, or you can use a different one.</p>

<textarea id="problem_description"></textarea>

<p>Approximately, what is the latest date by which you think you'll have made the decision, and you'll be able to say whether you're happy with the choice you made?</p>

<div class="mode" id="mode__problem_setup">

<p>Now your task is to list your decision's alternatives (options) and their pros and cons.</p>

<p>The idea is to represent each alternative with a set of "criteria", or features that make the alternative attractive or unattractive or you. For example, if you were deciding which job to take, a criterion could be <b>Salary</b>. I suggest using 2 to 7 criteria.</p>

<p>For each criterion, you'll set its possible values, or "levels". Levels are ordered with the <strong class="nb">worst first</strong> and the <strong class="nb">best last</strong>. So you might give <b>Salary</b> the levels <b>Low</b>, <b>Medium</b>, and <b>High</b>. Or you can use numbers as levels. The important thing is that level differences are big enough to matter: if two jobs have different salaries in dollars, but the difference is too small to affect your decision at all, you should use the same level of <b>Salary</b> for both. Level differences need not be equally important: you might care about <b>Salary</b> going from <b>Low</b> to <b>Medium</b> much more than from <b>Medium</b> to <b>High</b>.

<p>Here's a complete example of a situation in which somebody is deciding between job offers:</p>

<div class="problem_example">

<div>Alternatives</div>

<ul>
<li>Dewey, Cheatem &amp; Howe
<ul><li>Salary: Below average<li>Location: Close to home<li>Training opportunities: High</ul></li>
<li>Ray's Wraps
<ul><li>Salary: Average<li>Location: Far from home<li>Training opportunities: High</ul></li>
<li>MicroCo.
<ul><li>Salary: High<li>Location: Far from home<li>Training opportunities: Low</ul></li>
</ul>

<div>Criteria</div>

<ul>
<li>Salary
<ol><li>Below average<li>Average<li>High</ol></li>
<li>Location
<ol><li>Far from home<li>Close to home</ol></li>
<li>Training opportunities
<ol><li>Low<li>High</ol></li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Here's an example of a yes-or-no decision, in which somebody is deciding whether to drop out of college.</p>

<div class="problem_example">

<div>Alternatives</div>

<ul>
<li>Stay
<ul><li>Cost: High<li>Future job opportunities: Somewhat more<li>Social life: Better<li>Town I'll live in: Worse</ul></li>
<li>Drop out
<ul>
<li>Cost: Low<li>Future job opportunities: Somewhat less<li>Social life: Worse<li>Town I'll live in: Better</ul></li>
</ul>

<div>Criteria</div>

<ul>
<li>Cost
<ol><li>High<li>Low</ol></li>
<li>Future job opportunities
<ol><li>Somewhat less<li>Somewhat more</ol></li>
<li>Social life
<ol><li>Worse<li>Better</ol></li>
<li>Town I'll live in
<ol><li>Worse<li>Better</ol></li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Make sure to only include alternatives you could actually take, not just options you wish that you had. After all, the point of this exercise is to help you make a real choice. On the other hand, feel free to use criteria that involve best guesses, like how much you'll learn in a training program.</p>

<p>Enter the names of the alternatives you'd like to consider:</p>

<ul id="alt_entry">
<li id="new_alt_li">
<button id="new_alt" type="button">Add an alternative</button></li>
</ul>

<p>Enter the criteria you want to rate the alternatives on:</p>

<ul id="criteria_entry">
<li id="new_criterion_li">
<button id="new_criterion" type="button">Add a criterion</button></li>
</ul>

<p>After defining the criteria, use your alternative list above to choose the level of each criterion and each alternative. (You can continue editing the criteria, but doing so will reset your choices of criterion levels for the alternatives.)</p>

<div class="mode" id="mode__check_dominance">

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> According to your definitions, the alternative <b class="dominator"></b> dominates the others. This means that on all criteria, it's at least as good as all your other alternatives. So, you don't have much of a decision to make: the dominating alternative is your best option by definition.</p>

<p>This situation usually arises by mistake. For example, you may've forgotten to include a criterion that makes the other alternatives more appealing than <b class="dominator"></b> in some way.</p>

<p>You can go back and edit your criteria and alternatives, or you can continue if you feel that <b class="dominator"></b> dominating accurately represents your situation.</p>

<p>Now that you've described your decision situation in terms of criteria and alternatives, my program will try to help you pick the best alternative. It can't always provide useful information, but it will do its best. The idea is to ask you to choose between some hypothetical options that are hopefully easier to judge than the real alternatives. Then, the program will do some math to infer what should be the best alternative, given some basic assumptions about how preferences work. Ultimately, you don't have to go with the alternative that the program says you should; it's just a recommendation.</p>
