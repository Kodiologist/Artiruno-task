<p><strong>You're being asked to volunteer for a research study.</strong>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to understand how people can be helped to make better real-life decisions.

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>If you decide to be in this study, your part will involve thinking and answering questions about a weighty real-life decision that you haven't made yet, but you expect to make soon. You may also be asked demographic questions or asked to solve logic puzzles. There may be multiple conditions to which you could be assigned. If so, you'll be assigned to your condition randomly (by chance).

<p>After completing one session of the study, you may later be invited to complete another session. The next session will appear as a separate study on Prolific.

<h2>Risks, Discomforts, or Benefits</h2>
<p>By participating in this study, you may end up making a different choice from what you would otherwise, which could be better or worse. In this study, I'll only try to improve people's decisions, not make them worse, but an important purpose of this study is to find out whether my method works in the first place.

<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>You'll be paid for completing this study through Prolific according to the posted rate. Payments will increase in later sessions to encourage you to participate in all the sessions for which you're eligible.

<h2>Confidentiality (Protecting Your Privacy in this Study)</h2>
<p>I will never ask for personally identifying information. Your IP address won't be included in any public releases of the study data.

<h2>Costs to You</h2>
<p>There are no foreseeable costs for you as a subject in this study.

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Your alternative to being in this study is simply not to participate.

<h2>Your Rights as a Research Subject</h2>

<li>Your participation in this study is voluntary: you don't have to be in this study if you don't want to.
<li>You have the right to change your mind and leave the study at any time without giving any reason, and without penalty.
