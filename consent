<p><strong>You're being asked to volunteer for a research study.</strong>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>This study will ask about a weighty real-life decision that you haven't made yet, but you expect to make soon. So, you may only participate if you have such a decision to describe.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to understand how people can be helped to make better real-life decisions.

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>If you decide to be in this study, your part will involve thinking and answering questions about the decision, as well as answering demographic questions. There may be multiple conditions to which you could be assigned. If so, you'll be assigned to your condition randomly (by chance).

<h2>Risks, Discomforts, or Benefits</h2>
<p>By participating in this study, you may end up making a different choice from what you would otherwise, which could be better or worse. In this study, I'll only try to improve people's decisions, not make them worse, but part of the purpose of this study is to find out whether my method works in the first place.

<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>There's a reward of money assigned to the Human Intelligence Task (HIT) you've accepted. You'll receive this reward after completing the HIT provided that you didn't attempt the study more than once (even if the same study is associated with multiple HITs) and you made a good-faith attempt to follow the instructions.

<h2>Confidentiality (Protecting Your Privacy in this Study)</h2>
<p>I will never ask for personally identifying information. Your Worker ID and IP address will not be included in any public releases of the study data.

<h2>Costs to You</h2>
<p>There are no foreseeable costs for you as a subject in this study.

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Your alternative to being in this study is to simply not participate.

<h2>Your Rights as a Research Subject</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study if you don't want to be.
<li>You have the right to change your mind and leave the study (by selecting "Return HIT") at any time without giving any reason, and without penalty.
<li>Any new information that may make you change your mind about being in this study will be given to you.
<li>You do not lose any of your legal rights by giving your consent.
</ul>
